# Project Setup and Deployment Guide

This guide walks you through setting up a Django project, creating a Django app, and deploying it using Zappa.

## 1. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

## 2. Install Project Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 3. Create a Django Project and App

Follow the Django tutorial to create a project and app:

[Django Tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/tutorial01/)

```bash
django-admin startproject project_backend
python manage.py startapp project_domain
```

## 4. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root and configure your environment variables.

## 5. Comment Out Databases Snippet

In the `settings.py` file of your Django project (`project_backend`), comment out the databases snippet to prevent issues during development.

```python
# project_backend/settings.py

# ...

# DATABASES = {
#     'default': {
#         'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
#         'NAME': BASE_DIR / "db.sqlite3",
#     }
# }

# ...
```

## 6. Define URLs in `urls.py`

Define your URL patterns in the `urls.py` file of your Django app (`project_domain`). Here's a simple example:

```python
# project_domain/urls.py
from django.urls import path
from .views import HomePageView

urlpatterns = [
    path('', HomePageView.as_view(), name='home'),
    # Add more URL patterns as needed
]
```

## 7. Define Models

Set up your models in the `models.py` file of your Django app (`project_domain`).

## 8. Run the Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to see your development server in action.

## 9. Deploy with Zappa

### Install Zappa

```bash
pip install zappa
```

### Initialize Zappa Configuration

```bash
zappa init
```

Follow the prompts to configure your Zappa settings.

### Deploy to AWS Lambda

```bash
zappa deploy dev
```

### Update Deployment

```bash
zappa update dev
```

### Undeploy

```bash
zappa undeploy dev
```

This README provides a basic outline. Customize it based on your project specifics and add more sections as needed.
```

This addition guides users on defining URLs in the `urls.py` file before defining models in the Django app. Adjust the instructions as needed for your specific project structure and requirements.
